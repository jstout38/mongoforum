# Web Forum

A fully functional web forum build from scratch using a Ruby on Rails API and an AngularJS client. Angular Material and Bootstrap are used for much of the formatting.

The Ruby on Rails application uses MongoDB, a NoSQL, document-based data store. The API and the client assets are housed in the same file structure for cohesiveness. Devise is used for user authentication and authorization and is integrated into both the backend API and the client. Validation is mostly performed in the client but some is done in the backend when necessary.
